# Recipes App

## Summary
Taking a look at Vue from a React perspective. Found an interesting idea for a recipe app and I thought I'd give it a spin as it felt pretty free-form.

Idea taken from this [blog](https://www.blog.duomly.com/vue-js-project-ideas-for-beginners/):

>Idea number two is an app to keep your recipes in one place. If you have ever learned to cook, you can imagine how difficult it is to remember everything steps by step. The recipes app could be a great solution.
>
>It should consist of three main elements: the listing with all recipes, form for adding a new recipe and detailed view of the selected recipe. 
>
>Here you could practice using the Vue Router for displaying the recipes by id. 

### Step By Step
Time to get the CLI installed? No the Vue readme actually doesn't have any kind of suggestion to use their CLI (in fact they warn against doing it... so I guess we'll try it their way?). Creating index.html file w/vim brb.
